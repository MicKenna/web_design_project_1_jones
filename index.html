                                <p>“Rise and shine.
6am and your hand can’t make it to the alarm clock before the voices in your head start telling you that it’s too early, too dark, and too cold to get out of a bed.
Aching muscles lie still in rebellion, pretending not to hear your brain commanding them to move
A legion of voices are shouting their unanimous permission for you to hit the snooze button and go back to dreamland, but you didn’t ask their opinion.
The voice you’ve chosen to listen to is one of defiance.
A voice that’s says there was a reason you set that alarm in the first place. So sit up, put your feet on the floor, and don’t look back because we’ve got work to do.
Welcome to The Grind!
For what is each day but a series of conflicts between the right way and the easy way,
10,000 streams fan out like a river delta before you, Each one promising the path of least resistance.
Thing is, you’re headed upstream
And when you make that choice, when you decide to turn your back on what’s comfortable and what’s safe and what some would call “common sense”, well that’s day 1.
From there it only gets tougher.
So just make sure this is something you want.
Because the easy way out will always be there, ready to wash you away, all you have to do is pick up your feet.
But you aren’t going to are you?
With each step comes the decision to take another
You’re on your way now
But this is no time to dwell on how far you’ve come.
You’re in a fight against an opponent you can’t see
Oh but you can feel him on your heels can’t you?
Feel him breathing down your neck
You know what that is?
That’s you…
Your fears, your doubts and insecurities all lined up like a firing squad ready to shoot you out of the sky
But don’t lose heart
While they aren’t easily defeated, they are far from invincible
Remember this is The Grind
The Battle Royale between you and your mind, your body and the devil on your shoulder who’s telling you that this is just a game, this is just a waste of time, your opponents are stronger than you.
Drown out the voice of uncertainty with the sound of your own heartbeat
Burn away your self doubt with the fire that’s beneath you
Remember what you’re fighting for
And never forget that momentum is a cruel mistress
She can turn on a dime with the smallest mistake.
She is ever searching for that weak place in your armor
That one tiny thing you forgot to prepare for
So as long as the devil is hiding the details, the question remains,”is that all you got?”, “are you sure?”
And when the answer is “yes”. That you’ve done all you can to prepare yourself for battle THEN it’s time to go forth and boldly face your enemy, the enemy within
Only now you must take that fight into the open, into hostile territory
You’re a lion in a field of lions
All hunting the same elusive prey with a desperate starvation that says VICTORY is the only thing that can keep you alive
So believe that voice that says “you CAN run a little faster” and that “you CAN throw a little harder” and that “you CAN dive a little deeper” and that, for you, the laws of physics are merely a suggestion.
So rise and shine. </p>

          <p><strong>Cool Guys Dont Look at Explosions: </strong>Seems like these days the whole world's on fire
Things keep blowing the hell up
And while all those rubber-neckers and looky-loos stand slack-jawed starin
The real men have the nuts to walk away
Mmm yeah
Cool guys don't look at explosions
They blow things up and then walk away
Who's got time to watch an explosion
There's cool guy errands that they have to walk to
Keep walkin, keep shinin
Don't look back, keep on walkin
Keep struttin, slow motion
The more you ignore it, the cooler you look
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Mr. Niel Diamond!
Ha, ha, ha, where are we?
Cool guys don't look at explosions
They stride forward in their diamond studded boots
They wear jumpsuits of glittery rhinestones
And walk away in slow motion
Keep walkin, you're cruisin
Cherry cherry, sweet Caroline
Denzel walks, Will Smith walks
Mark Wahlberg is wearing a hat
Keyboard solo!.... J.J.Abrams!
Yeah!
Now you're talkin!
Woohoo!
Okay
Because!
Cool guys don't look at explosions (no they don't!)
The flames are hot but their heart is chill (ooh! ooh! hoo! hoo!)
Walk fast from that boring explosion (boring explosion!)
And don't think about the people you've killed
Two, three, four!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!.</p>

No.

We are all evil, and it's beautiful!
We are all evil, and it's beautiful!
We are all evil, and it's beautiful!

I can dance all day, I can dance all day
Try hit me, try hit me, c'mon!
I mean my heart's beating, my heart's beating
My hands are shaking, my hands are shaking
But I'm still shooting, and I'm still getting the head shots
It's like boom head shot, boom head shot
Boom head shot!

Head shot!
