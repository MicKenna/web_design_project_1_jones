So sit up, put your feet on the floor, and don’t look back because we’ve got work to do.Welcome to The Grind!For what is each day but a series of conflicts between the right way and the easy way,10,000 streams fan out like a river delta before you, Each one promising the path of least resistance.Thing is, you’re headed upstreamAnd when you make that choice, when you decide to turn your back on what’s comfortable and what’s safe and what some would call “common sense”, well that’s day 1.From there it only gets tougher.So just make sure this is something you want.Because the easy way out will always be there, ready to wash you away, all you have to do is pick up your feet.But you aren’t going to are you?With each step comes the decision to take anotherYou’re on your way nowBut this is no time to dwell on how far you’ve come.You’re in a fight against an opponent you can’t seeOh but you can feel him on your heels can’t you?Feel him breathing down your neckYou know what that is?That’s you…Your fears, your doubts and insecurities all lined up like a firing squad ready to shoot you out of the skyBut don’t lose heartWhile they aren’t easily defeated, they are far from invincibleRemember this is The GrindThe Battle Royale between you and your mind, your body and the devil on your shoulder who’s telling you that this is just a game, this is just a waste of time, your opponents are stronger than you.Drown out the voice of uncertainty with the sound of your own heartbeatBurn away your self doubt with the fire that’s beneath youRemember what you’re fighting forAnd never forget that momentum is a cruel mistressShe can turn on a dime with the smallest mistake.She is ever searching for that weak place in your armorThat one tiny thing you forgot to prepare forSo as long as the devil is hiding the details, the question remains,”is that all you got?”, “are you sure?”And when the answer is “yes”. That you’ve done all you can to prepare yourself for battle THEN it’s time to go forth and boldly face your enemy, the enemy withinOnly now you must take that fight into the open, into hostile territoryYou’re a lion in a field of lionsAll hunting the same elusive prey with a desperate starvation that says VICTORY is the only thing that can keep you aliveSo believe that voice that says “you CAN run a little faster” and that “you CAN throw a little harder” and that “you CAN dive a little deeper” and that, for you, the laws of physics are merely a suggestion.So rise and shine.</p><br><p>You Know the music time to dance</p><span><a></a></span> </div><div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Sign Up</button> </div></div></div></div><div class="modal fade" id="css3_modal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myModalLabel"> <div class="modal-dialog" role="document"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-header"> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span></button> <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Sniper</h4> </div><div class="modal-body"> <img src="images/taticool.jpg"> <br><p><strong>BOOM HEADSHOT: </strong>Do you like his music?No.We are all evil, and it's beautiful!We are all evil, and it's beautiful!We are all evil, and it's beautiful!We are all evil, and it's beautiful!I can dance all day, I can dance all dayTry hit me, try hit me, c'mon!I mean my heart's beating, my heart's beatingMy hands are shaking, my hands are shakingBut I'm still shooting, and I'm still getting the head shotsIt's like boom head shot, boom head shotBoom head shot!Head shot!We are all evil, and it's beautiful!We are all evil, and it's beautiful!We are all evil, and it's beautiful!We are all evil, and it's beautiful!We are all evil, and it's beautiful!We are all evil, and it's beautiful!We are all evil, and it's beautiful!We are all evil, and it's beautiful!I can dance all day, I can dance all dayTry hit me, try hit me, c'mon!I mean my heart's beating, my heart's beatingMy hands are shaking, my hands are shakingBut I'm still shooting, and I'm still getting the head shotsIt's like boom head shot, boom head shotBoom head shot!Head shot!</p><br><p>One shot one kill</p><span><a></a></span> </div><div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Sign Up</button> </div></div></div></div><script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <script src="js/main.js"></script> </body></html>
